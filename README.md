# Pollution-control-
The relationship between humanity and the environment is a delicate balance. Since the industrial revolution, the world's population has increased exponentially, and with the population growth, the environment has been profoundly affected.
With the help of new technologies we can control on the pollution with control in pollutants in environment.
Mainly focused on Ozone, particular matter, carbon monoxide , sulphur dioxide , nitrous oxide.
The main pollutants are in atmosplere are
(1) Carbon dioxide CO2
(2) Sulphur dioxide SO2
(3) Nitrous oxide N2O
Air have many of gases some are useful for us and some have bad effects on us , those components which affects Biological system are known as pollutants in term of Pollution.
We have a technique to overcome the amount of pollutants in air
It is with the help of Blast freezing of gases to melt the harmful components in air and then use of GAS LIQUID SEPERATOR
The melting pionts are as shown below:
Gas          Melting point
oxygen        -218.8* C
Nitrogen      -210.0* C
CO2            -56.0* C
SO2            -72.0* C
N2O            -90.9* C
Here we can see that the melting popint of pollutants are more then useful gases so here we can consider a temperature of -100* C
